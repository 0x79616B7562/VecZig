0.2.0
- added some promised features:
    - truncate - shortens vec
    - drain - remove range from vec and returns it as Vec(T)

- slices are now returned as Vec(T) so they need to be freed in order to prevent memleaks
    this is because drain returns it as vec(t) to prevent changes of original values
    so these two functions should behave the same

- various bugfixes, and memory leak fixes

------

0.1.0
